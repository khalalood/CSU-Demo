# CSU-Demo
This a Project I created in my Object Oriented Programming class. 
This program was an MVP desgined for my Universities Student Union to allow students to reserve rooms on campus for their events. 
The flow allows users to login, select a room, choose any requirments and reserve the room. 

This program was written in C# and the data is stored in a mySQL database
